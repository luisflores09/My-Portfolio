# MyPortfolio

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## CI/CD: Deploy to S3 on push

This repo includes a basic GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Angular app and syncs `dist/my-portfolio/` to an S3 bucket on push to `master`/`main`.

### 1) Add GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION` (example: `us-east-1`)
- `S3_BUCKET` (bucket name only, example: `my-portfolio-site`)

### 2) Configure the S3 bucket for a SPA

If you use **S3 static website hosting**, set:

- **Index document**: `index.html`
- **Error document**: `index.html` (SPA route fallback)

### 3) Push to deploy

Any push to `master`/`main` will build and deploy via `.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml`.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
